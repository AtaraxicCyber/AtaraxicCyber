# Hi there, I'm [Your First Name]! 👋

I'm a Cybersecurity student at **Brigham Young University-Idaho**, specializing in Cloud Security and Automation.

I chose the handle **AtaraxicCyber** because I believe in maintaining *ataraxia*—a state of serene calmness and clarity—even when systems are critical or under pressure. My goal is to bring that steady, logical approach to digital defense.

## 🔭 About Me

- 🎓 **Current Status:** I am an undergraduate majoring in Cybersecurity.
- 🌱 **I’m currently learning:** Cloud infrastructure hardening (AWS), advanced Linux administration, and preparing for my **Security+** and **AWS Cloud Practitioner** certifications.
- 🎯 **My goals:** To secure a Cybersecurity Internship by early 2026 and transition into a full-time Cloud Security Engineer role.
- ⚡ **Ask me about:** PowerShell automation, the ethics of AI, or how Stoic philosophy applies to Incident Response.

## 🛠️ Technologies and Tools

I focus heavily on scripting and infrastructure. Here are the tools I work with daily:
